# DevOps-Project-Sports-API-Management-System-Deployment
This project demonstrates building a containerized API management system for querying sports data. It leverages Amazon ECS (Fargate) for running containers, Amazon API Gateway for exposing REST endpoints, and an external Sports API for real-time sports data.
